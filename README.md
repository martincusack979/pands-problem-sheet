**Weekly Tasks 02:**
*Write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI). Call the file bmi.py.*

To perform this calculation, you need to write a basic function in Python. BMI is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in metres squared,
which in Python can be expressed by using *bmi = weight / height ** 2*. First I need the user to inout their weight and height using the input function: eg *"weight = int(input("enter your weight(kg): "))* I used this together with a function which returns *return("Your BMI is " + str(bmi))* to give the desired result in output pane which is *Your BMI is 23.98687034465345*


**Weekly Task 03:**
*Write a program that asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order.*

In Python, you can specify a range by using a colon.  The object of this week's task is to use this feature to print out every second letter of a phrase in reverse order.
In order to print every second letter in order, you could use the code [::2].  To print every second letter in reverse order, you need to alter this to [::-2]. When teh string "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is entered, this code outputs the desired result, which is ".o zletrv pu o wr cu h"
*Reference: I consulted Stack Overflow to help with this task. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48873854/python-printing-ever-other-letter-of-a-word

**Weekly Task 04:**
COLLATZ: *Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one.Have the program end if the current value is one.*
