**Weekly Tasks 02:**
*Write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI). Call the file bmi.py.*

To perform this calculation, you need to write a basic function in Python. BMI is calculated by dividing weight in kilograms by height in metres squared,
which in Python can be expressed by using *bmi = weight / height ** 2*. First I need the user to inout their weight and height using the input function: eg *"weight = int(input("enter your weight(kg): "))* I used this together with a function which returns *return("Your BMI is " + str(bmi))* to give the desired result in output pane which is Your BMI is 23.98687034465345



**Weekly Task 03:**
*Write a program that asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order.*

In Python, you can specify a range by using a colon.  The object of this week's task is to use this feature to print out every second letter of a phrase in reverse order.
In order to print every second letter in order, you could use the code [::2].  To print every second letter in reverse order, you need to alter this to [::-2]. When teh string "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is entered, this code outputs the desired result, which is ".o zletrv pu o wr cu h"
*Reference: I consulted stack overflow to help with this task. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48873854/python-printing-ever-other-letter-of-a-word
